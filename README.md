# Personal Rust Signage Directory
A simple website to display images to use for Rust's /SIL command. There is a single array near the top of the page where the user (you) are able to add additional URLs to uploaded images. This is meant as a simple tool for those who like to make use of the Rust Sign Image Loader MOD to quickly and easily copy the contents of an image (PNG/JPG) onto various signs in game.

## Possible Additions
* Quick View of Sign Image Dimensions
* Cleaner Scrolling
* Collapsable Grouping Images by Category
