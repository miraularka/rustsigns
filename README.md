# Personal Rust Signage Directory
A simple website to display images to use for Rust's /SIL command. There is a single array near the top of the page where the user (you) are able to add additional URLs to uploaded images. This is meant as a simple tool for those who like to make use of the Rust Sign Image Loader MOD to quickly and easily copy the contents of an image (PNG/JPG) onto various signs in game.

## Usage
Adding and removing your sign images is a very straight forward process. Open up 'signs.html' in your favorite editor. Locate the 'signs' array - around line 8. Remove the example URLs and populate it with your own. You can force a few linebreaks by including "|" as an entry. Doing so should be useful in keeping similar signs grouped together.


## Possible Additions

* Collapsable Grouping Images by Category
